# Flask Projects
## Set of Flask websites

In this repo you'll find some different projects made with Flask,
axed on interractions between user/user or user/computer (or both.

They are very unstable so please do yourself a favor and create a issue if you found bugs !
(Works only on LAN)

Note : Some of these projects have been forked : Video Call and Chat. You can easily find them on GitHub.

You'll need to install some libraries, we look forward to add virtual environnment to
avoid downloading libraries by yourself.
